# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for helping us grow this list!

## The most important thing
The pull request should have a useful title. Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as title will be closed right away because I'm so tired of nobody reading this document. Please carefully read everything in `Adding to this list`.

## Contribution Guidelines
Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Updating your Pull Request
Sometimes, we can ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match our guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
